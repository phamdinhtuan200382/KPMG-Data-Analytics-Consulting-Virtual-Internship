Hi there,

As per voicemail, please find the 3 datasets attached from Sprocket Central Pty Ltd:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transaction data in the past three months
Can you please review the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two. Remember to take note of any assumptions or issues we need to go back to the client on. As well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.

I’ve also attached a data quality framework as a guideline. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Kind Regards
Your Manager

Here is your task:
Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.
